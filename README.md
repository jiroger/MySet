<h1> The MySet Repository </h1>
<p> Hello! Here is where you'll find the source code for my recreation of the card game Set using Java 8 and Processing 3. If you want to download the runnable jar, <a href="https://jiroger.github.io/assets/code/MySetRunnable.jar">click here</a>. I tried my best to integrate it with a webpage, but because most modern browsers are dropping support for the applet tag (which was made specifically for Java applets in mind), I wasn't able to make that possible... yet. Enjoy!
