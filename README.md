<h1> The MySet Repository </h1>
<p> Hello! Here is where you'll find the source code for my recreation of the card game set using Java/Procesing. If you want to download the runnable jar, <a href="www.rogerji.me/assets/code/MySetRunnable.jar">click here</a>. I tried my best to integrate it with a webpage, but because most modern browsers are dropping support for the <applet> tag, I wasn't able to make that possible. Enjoy!
